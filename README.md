Hi I am @hero-hiralal
I have been learning ethical hacking and web-dev for the past 2 months
I am a hungry learner and will be posting as I learn.
Currently I know some basic malware-development and I am focusing on WEB-PEN
I dont have a formal education so I am learning the hard way.
I am pretty good with linux and can make the system stable accotding to the user's needs.
Will be posting soon about the projects I work on, and I am open for collab.
