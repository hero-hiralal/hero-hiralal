It is an information channel which show cases the topics in the computer world.
Our motto is to spread linux knowledge, ethical hacking, system stabilization in terms of professionalism to every one who wants to work in this field.

Keeping the journey simple and straight forward as possible.
You may wonder that to learn we need some prerequisetes? 
Well our system is strainght forward for begginers to learn.
The ingredients we will use are:

A Computer or a laptop with good internet connection 
One thing to keep in mind is to use a mordern computer.
Not 32 bit architecture which are long gone with no support.
proccesors after 8th gen are reccomended along side of 16 gigabyte of ram
with whatever type of hhd or ssd you prefer. Most people say that 8 gb ram
is enough but when using heavy programs or while researching it may cause lags.
As It has been seen on windows systems the ram usage is 30 percent just in idle state
because its a resource hungry operation system hence more ram better for us...
