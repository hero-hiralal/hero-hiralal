APKTOOL-FIX

ABOUT SCRIPT>
This script has been for a solution for apktool error which the user might have encountered while using msfvenom or maybe
manually compiling android apps for development purposes. This is a typical fault with the kali repository which has some packages
outdated as most likely the user will be greeted with a package induced error which in this scenerio points towards apktool 2.7.0+dsfg. This is more likely a automation script to save time from manually doing so.  




VERSION
The version I have included in this script is 2.9.3 you can check out https://ibotpeaches.com for the latest version and change
line 16's link after "wget" command to your desired version from IbotPeaches Website.
